# my-blogging app
- I created this app on Django. 
- This app can add and create a post.
- To delete a post, you must enter into the admin section and delete the respective post.
- I'll merge a PR if someone comes with delete action for a post.
- I myself referred django-girls.com to create this app and would recommend as well. 
- Only if you know Django beforehand or do not have enough time to learn Django, clone this repo and try to understand the essence of Django.
- Command to run the app on your local server (Linux with python3): ```python3 manage.py runserver```
- Remember to activate the virtual environment.
